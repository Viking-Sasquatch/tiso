# TISO

The TISO (Title Industry Standards Organization) project aims to provide a standard set of data structures and helper libraries for use in exchanging data.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

Dates used in the JSON are in [RFC3339](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3339) format.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

To validate JSON files individually, install jsonlint:

```
npm install jsonlint -g
```

Validate a file like this:

```
jsonlint myfile.json
```

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

## Deployment

Add additional notes about how to deploy this on a live system
